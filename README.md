# Aviameter
A GPS-based Flight Statistics Tracker. Displays your real-time speed, altitude, vertical speed and more in-flight.  

Uses [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) (with TypeScript), and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) ([React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)) for map-rendering.  

This project also makes use of Service Worker to cache all data required to run the tool on first visit, making it usable in offline conditions, including when airplane mode is enabled.

Map data is generated by AshKyd's geojson-regions tools ([Github](https://github.com/AshKyd/geojson-regions)) (https://geojson-maps.ash.ms/)
